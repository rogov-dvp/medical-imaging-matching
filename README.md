# medical-imaging-matching
medical-imaging-matching is a model developed for BC Cancer that will return a similarity index for two mammogram images. This will help BC Cancer eliminate duplicate mammograms from their data increasing accuracy for further medical research, specifically in the use of AI as duplicates or missing information within a dataset can cause bias. Within this project we have developed various models to detect image similarity as well as developed a preprocessing script to curate datasets and split them into training and testing groups.
