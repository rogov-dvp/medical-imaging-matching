# Initial Test Images

## Client Suggestion
As using data from the client database may take some more time (privacy issues), it is suggested to start with publicly available pictures. Also the resolution of the images doesn't matter to much according to the client, at least for getting started.

## Problem
As the main goal is to identify duplicates, it is hard to find a proper dataset as most/all data currently found do not contain any patient identifiers, making it hard to build even a small dataset.

## Suggested Solution
Start working with a very small dataset (included in this folder), to get things set up for the next steps and be able to switch to real data easily.
