## Limitations with NumPy Files 
Exploration into limitations and difficulties we may encounter with Numpy files

## What are NumPy Files
A NumPy array file created by the Python software package with the NumPy library installed is known as an NPY file. It contains a NumPy (NPY) array.

## Uses
- NumPy files can be used for a variety of things such as mathematical operations on arrays
- Used for scientific computing 
- It is an open source library
- NumPy files are very useful for data analysis
- useful for reading the same csv file multiple times
- uses much less memory to store data


## Importing NumPy
- import the numpy package
- import numpy as np


## Limitations 
- Require a continuous memory allocation: When data is stored in continuous memory regions, insertion and deletion operations become expensive because they require shifting.
- Lack of cross platform support
- problems could occur whencomparing values
- Must be contained in a single file
- Many import errors can occur due to compatibility 
- Must have correct python verison
- Memory overflow when using NumPyload
- Issues occuring with file formats
