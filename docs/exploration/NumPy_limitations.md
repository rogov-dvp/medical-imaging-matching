## Limitations with NumPy Files 
Exploration into limitations and difficulties we may encounter with Numpy files

## What are NumPy Files
A NumPy array file created by the Python software package with the NumPy library installed is known as an NPY file. It contains a NumPy (NPY) array.


## Uses
- NumPy files can be used for a variety of things such as mathematical operations on arrays
- Used for scientific computing 
- It is an open source library
- NumPy files are very useful for data analysis
- useful for reading the same csv file multiple times
- uses much less memory to store data


## Importing NumPy
- import the numpy package
- import numpy as np


## Limitations 
- Require a continuous memory allocation: When data is stored in continuous memory regions, insertion and deletion operations become expensive because they require shifting.
- Lack of cross platform support
- problems could occur when comparing values
- Must be contained in a single file
- Many import errors can occur due to compatibility 
- Must have correct python verison
- Memory overflow when using NumPyload
- Issues occuring with file formats


## Specific Limitations 

By using NumPy, we can simplify vectorization, for the entire layer and whole batch of examples at once. This eliminates iteration and speeds up our calculations significantly. 

- Import errors due to compatibility, especially when using the remote server
- Need to be careful when it comes to file formats for structured data
- Remember not to use the matrix function from the NumPy class and instead use regular arrays
- Use the correct function when changing shape or array or matrix
- Both NumPy and Keras model produce similar accuracy
