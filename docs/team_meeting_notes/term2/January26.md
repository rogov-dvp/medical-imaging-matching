# Team Meeting Notes
## January 26, 2022

### Attendees:
- Alex Rogov
- Emily Medema
- Marieke Gutter-Spence
- Niklas Tecklenburg

### Project
#### Progress
- Adjusted skeleton
- Finished regression testing
- Worked on the breast detection algorithm
- Research the image compression
- Looked at connected CNN to preprocessing
- How to for integration testing
- Added more in depth testing for CNN
- Exploration into implementation of batch building

#### BLockers/Surprises
- Issue with Infininte loss with gradient 
- Loss function limitations in current skeleton
- Deciding which way to connnect CNN model to CNN
- Training process issue 

### Learning Activity 
-  Small presentation with TA
-  Continue work on breast detection
-  Continue work with the batch builder
-  Pre processing needs to be implemented on the remote server
-  Limitations of a Numpy file 
-  Work on training process issue 


### Plan

#### Tasks for this week:
- Work on issue with gradient and loss function research (Niklas)
- Work on training issue (Niklas)
- Adjusting pre processsing to remote server (Emily)
- Connection of CNN and pre processing (Emily)
- Continue implementation of batch building (Marieke)
- Limitations of a Numpy file ( Marieke)
- Breast detection algorithm (Alex)
- Testing for breast detection (Alex)

####  Goals for the next milestone
1. Optimzing pre-processing and Model 
2. Adjusting test training, hyperparameters
3. Refactoring images in order to run, apply transfer learning
