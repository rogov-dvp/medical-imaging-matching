### Plan

#### Tasks for this week:
- Work on the issue with OpenCV (Emily)
- Finish conection and implement testing (Emily)
- Continue implementation of batch building and solve the embeddings  (Marieke)
- Finish breast detection algorithm (Alex)
- Testing for breast detection (Alex)
- Continue to fix the gradient issue (Niklas)

####  Goals for the next milestone
1. Optimzing pre-processing and Model 
2. Adjusting test training, hyperparameters
3. Refactoring images in order to run, apply transfer learning
