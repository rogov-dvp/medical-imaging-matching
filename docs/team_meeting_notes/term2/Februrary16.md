# Team Meeting Notes
## February 16, 2022

### Attendees:
- Alex Rogov
- Emily Medema
- Marieke Gutter-Spence
- Niklas Tecklenburg

### Project
#### Progress
- Added unit tests for Batch Builder
- Worked on implementation to remote server
- Adjusting the models, for training and improvement
- Exploration in to the integration of batch building 
- Started implementation of the batch building 
- Got mammogram detection algorithm running 




#### BLockers/Surprises
- Compatibility issues with tensor flow versions varying
- Gradient Issue, now know where it is coming from. CNN says there is no real loss for the embedding




### Learning Activity 
- Continue exploration of integration for batch building on GPU server
- Continue research on Embedding issues more in depth 
- Finish unit tests for batch building 
- Finish implementation on remote server
- Adjusting and working with the model on GPU server
- Continue on getting the mammogram detection algorithm running 



### Plan

#### Tasks for this week:
- Adjusting and working with improving model on GPU server (Niklas)
- Finish up implementation on remote server (Emily)
- Finish up the unit tests for batch building (Marieke)
- Continue exploration of integration of batch building on GPU server (Marieke)
- Continue research on embedding issues (Emily)
- Continue work on the breast detection algorithm (Alex)
- Implement testing for mammogram alorithm (Alex)



####  Goals for the next milestone
1. Optimzing pre-processing and Model 
2. Adjusting test training, hyperparameters
3. Refactoring images in order to run, apply transfer learning
