## January 19, 2022

### Attendees:
- Alex Rogov
- Emily Medema
- Marieke Gutter-Spence
- Niklas Tecklenburg

### Project
#### Progress
- Refamiliarized with the current code
- Run and resolve issues on the remote server
- Research of Transfer learning through tensorflow
- Documentation of other approaches

#### BLockers/Surprises
- Issues with remote server
- Loss function limitations in current skeleton

### Learning Activity 
- Take a look at specifics for cropping and scaling images
- Adjust gantt chart
- Limitations to Numpy files
- Documentation include why we chose to go with current approach and add as to why not for the other approaches 
- Connecting the pre processing to the model with more efficiency 

### Plan

#### Tasks for this week:
- Research image compression (Emily)
- Gantt chart (Niklas)
- Research and connection of cnn to pre processing with integration testing (Emily)
- Fixing issues with the skeleton in order to learn lat layers (Niklas)
- Taking a look at batch builder, which combination to choose (Marieke)
- Limitations with the Numpy files (Marieke)
- Breast detection algorithm, for optimizing the input (Alex)
- Look into aspects of re-sizing (Alex)
- More indepth testing for CNN (Marieke)
- Regression testing and implementing that (Alex)

####  Goals for the next milestone
1. Optimzing pre-processing and Model 
2. Adjusting test training, hyperparameters
3. Refactoring images in order to run, apply transfer learning
