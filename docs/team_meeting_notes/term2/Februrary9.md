# Team Meeting Notes
## February 2, 2022

### Attendees:
- Alex Rogov
- Emily Medema
- Marieke Gutter-Spence
- Niklas Tecklenburg

### Project
#### Progress
- Solved issue with OpenCV on remote
- Implementation of batch building finished
- Integration testing on what we have for CNN and pre-processing connection
- Worked on solving the gradient issue, trained model gives embedding for what image net says
- Worked on breast detection algorithm



#### BLockers/Surprises
- Compatibility issues with tensor flow versions
- Gradient Issue, now know where it is coming from. CNN says there is no real loss for the embedding



### Learning Activity 
- Finalize the integration testing 
- implementing scripts onto remote server
- Adjust cost function 
- Work on gradient issue
- Keep working on breast detection algorithm
- unit testing for batch building and explore the integration



### Plan

#### Tasks for this week:
- Assisting Niklas with embedding (Emily)
- Adjust cost function to solve issues with gradient (Niklas)
- Work on finishing implementing scripts on remote server (Emily)
- Keep working on the training of breast detection algorithm (Alex)
- Unit testing for batch building/ Exploration into integration for batch building (Marieke)



####  Goals for the next milestone
1. Optimzing pre-processing and Model 
2. Adjusting test training, hyperparameters
3. Refactoring images in order to run, apply transfer learning
