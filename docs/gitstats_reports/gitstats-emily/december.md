   - Implemented `preprocess_data.py` file that resizes images and saves them as a numpy array based on type of mammogram.
   - Tested `preprocess_data.py` by implementing the required unit-tests.
   - Worked on the peer-testing report and compared our progress to our milestone goals.

Notes:

During our Requirements milestone we planned to have completed the implementation of the preprocessing; the organization and structure of our repo, models, and storage; building of the training test dataset; the implementation and beginnings of the optimization of the first model and some basic models; and the testing of the preprocessing and model (See Figure 2).

We have completed all of the above and are prepared to move on to the Peer Testing #2 features, which are primarily optimizing and continuing development on the model(s).
