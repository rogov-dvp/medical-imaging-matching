  - Spent most of the day at school working on a Windows computer (tensorflow works there). Currently, I have been running into lots of package problems. I plan to look more on this tomorrow.

3. Mammogram Detection model is now trained and got a script running that will crop images once I figure out how to use the trained model. I will continue working on this a bit later in the week

- Got the model running! Now, I just need to figure out how to use this trained model and apply the labels to the input of images.

4. Continued wokring on mammogram. I got code that should have been working with model and it shows a picture with the label. But, I was having issues with the label showing. I think it might be the model which is the issue.
