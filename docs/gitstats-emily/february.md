For: Emily Medema

### Weekly Breakdowns

Refer to git commits for the rest of the breakdowns.

1) Week of February 7th, 2022

   - Worked on connecting preprocessing and CNN on the remote server
   - Worked on ensuring that the preprocessing and CNN on remote server work and are referencing the correct places.
   - Fixed small git issue on remote server
   - Researched into triplet loss function and its encoding/gradient descent in relation to issue #270

2) Week of February 14th, 2022
   - Worked on connecting preprocessing and CNN on the remote server
   - Worked on ensuring that the preprocessing and CNN on remote server work and are referencing the correct places.
      - This will be finished by end of reading break.
   - Continued research into triplet loss function and its encoding/gradient descent in relation to issue #283

Notes:

The research on embedding needs the background research and documentation done on the triplet loss function for better understanding. Issue will be adjusted and closed to reflect that. A new issue next week will be opened regarding embedding and further research.

Furthe research has been done into our specific issue, but we need more research into how using mammograms instead of the images typically used affects our model.

Gitstats will not reflect work done on remote server.
