Notes:

The research on embedding needs the background research and documentation done on the triplet loss function for better understanding. Issue will be adjusted and closed to reflect that. A new issue next week will be opened regarding embedding and further research.

Further research has been done into our specific issue, but we need more research into how using mammograms instead of the images typically used affects our model.

Work on powerpoint and edited together video.

Gitstats will not reflect work done on remote server.
