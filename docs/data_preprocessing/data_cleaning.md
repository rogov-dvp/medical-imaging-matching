## Data Cleaning

 Data cleaing is the process of, correcting or deleting incorrect, corrupted, improperly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data from a dataset is known as data cleaning. There are numerous potential for data duplication or mislabeling when merging data.

### Techniques
<ol>
  <li>Remove duplicates</li>
  <li>Fix errors with structure</li>
  <li>Find unwanted outliers</li>
  <li>Handle any missing data</li>
</ol>

### Libraries
 Some possible libraires to use in the process of data cleaning:

 <ul>
  <li>OpenCV</li>
  <li>Tensorflow</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>NumPy</li>
</ul>

### Implementation

Our main focus will be to identify the "dirty" data types and fix them as appropriate. COnsidering that our dat sent is comprised of images we need to focus on formatting errors and consistency. We also need to keep in mind the flow when preprocessing.
