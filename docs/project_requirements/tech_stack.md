- Based on the pros and cons list surrounding each of the different libraries and frameworks we have researched, we are currently going to be using TensorFlow. We have chosen to go with TensorFlow since it appears to be the best option for high-level modeling due to its extensiveness. TensorFlow also offers great documentation and visualization, making it easy to deploy. Although TensorFlow may come with a steep learning curve and difficulties debugging, the pros outweigh these cons. Besides Tensorflow we are planning to use OpenCV for several preprocessing tasks.
