| Cyclops           | 0  | <ul><li>We think the slides could have been done a bit more organized. For example, under User Groups, why not list the three different user groups then write a small description about them under it.</li><li>DFD level 1 was nicely done.</li><li>Regarding "choosing tech stack", why is Unity considered for a web development project. Just seems a bit strange As well, isn't having to choose any of the three biggest JavaScript Frameworks with Ionic would be considered a "pro" attribute? Additionally, we are a bit confused about what does "Transitioning from app into website is easier" mean. Did you mean to say that it's easy to turn an ionic app into an android or ios app?</li><li>Testing was good, nice</li><li>Final note, 13:37min, is significantly longer than the 10min limit for the video.</li><ul>|
| Cyclops           | 1  | <ul><li>DFD looks very nice and clean, especially DFD level 1.</li><li>Why is basic styling included in Peer Testing #1. We feel like that is not an essential part of the project. Shouldn't something like the Eco Tracker (or atleast a portion?) be part of Peer Testing #1.</li><li>We think it would great if the team could explain how they plan to work with the other Cyclops groups. We say this becuse it seems like other groups plan to use different stack. So, how could different tech stack come together or is each team creating their own web app?</li><li>Why was Ruby on Rails chosen over something popular like React.js?</li><li>We like the egyption/nature background music :)</li><ul>|
| Cyclops           | 2  | <ul><li>The DFD are missing the objects being passed between the components. They are quite essential to understanding a DFD.</li><li>Regarding testing, isn't your team the "developers" who need to choose a testing? We think it would be great hear which testing method your team chooses</li><li>Just a thought, in the Non-Function Requirements slide, it is stated that a well defined technical documentation is required. How will your team ensure that they will develop this. Ie. does your team plan to update the technical document as they create features or will it all be completed by the end of the Peer Testing?</li><li>Overall, a solid presentation</li></ul>|

| LIMS              | 0  | - Really good intro clarified the project and its relevance
                           - You really put some effort into the planning and structuring of your project, we feel like you know how to tackle th upcoming challenges
                           - We had some issues following DFD Level 1 as the picture was blurry and the description of it was high level, maybe you can clarify this in the report if not already done
                           - Your Milestone planning looked pretty high level maybe it will help you to make a more detailed deadline plan for every feature, for the first mileston, to keep track of the progress 
                           - Were there any other reasons for choosing django than your experience?
                           - Good Test planning |
| LIMS              | 1  | - We really liked your explanation of how you came up with the tech stack
                           - Your DFD was pretty high level so it is kind of hard to give very detailed feedback
                           - Maybe it will be helpful to include a more detailed plan of feature deadlines so you can keep track of your progress|
| LIMS              | 2  | - Good introduction into your project, helped us to understand the rest better
                           - very detailed non functional requirements, this gave us the feeling you are really aware of what to wtch out for
                           - It could be helpful to plan your progress and deadlines a bit more detailed, so you can keep track of your progress|
| Ethics Dashboard  | 0  | <ul><li>Audio looped when explaining about APIs they were planning on using.</li><li>The audio during the explanation of the DFD was very choppy which made it hard to understand.</li><li>There is no mention of testing on the actual code, are you going to be performing any form of unit or integration testing?</li><li>We found the DFD diagrams hard to read initially, as it sometimes seems like while you used a singular directional arrow data was actually flowing both ways.</li></ul>|
| Ethics Dashboard  | 1  | <ul><li>We found your DFDs to be very clear and detailed, good work!</li><li>How do your milestones correspond with the milestones we must meet in class?</li><li>The testing plan is very comprehensive and the diagrams shown helped illustrate your plan well.</li><li>We liked that a consideration for your tech stack was maintainability by future developers. Good forward thinking!</li></ul>|
| Ethics Dashboard  | 2  | <ul><li>How are you integrating Google Docs for collboration? Are they just going to be linked to a google document? Will it be a view within the site?</li><li>Your DFDs are very detailed. Generally speaking, level0 DFDs usually show the system as a single process with its relationship to external entities. We would recommend reviewing the DFD level0 and level1 definitions and potentially refactoring yours.</li><li>It is unclear which features are to be done by what milestone in the DFD and the features assigned to milestones wasn't elaborated on.</li><li>What are you using to perform unit and function tests?</li></ul> |
