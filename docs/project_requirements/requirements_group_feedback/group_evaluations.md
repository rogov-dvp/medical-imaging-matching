| LIMS              | 0  | - Really good intro clarified the project and its relevance
                           - You really put some effort into the planning and structuring of your project, we feel like you know how to tackle th upcoming challenges
                           - We had some issues following DFD Level 1 as the picture was blurry and the description of it was high level, maybe you can clarify this in the report if not already done
                           - Your Milestone planning looked pretty high level maybe it will help you to make a more detailed deadline plan for every feature, for the first mileston, to keep track of the progress 
                           - Were there any other reasons for choosing django than your experience?
                           - Good Test planning |
| LIMS              | 1  | - We really liked your explanation of how you came up with the tech stack
                           - Your DFD was pretty high level so it is kind of hard to give very detailed feedback
                           - Maybe it will be helpful to include a more detailed plan of feature deadlines so you can keep track of your progress|
| LIMS              | 2  | - Good introduction into your project, helped us to understand the rest better
                           - very detailed non functional requirements, this gave us the feeling you are really aware of what to wtch out for
                           - It could be helpful to plan your progress and deadlines a bit more detailed, so you can keep track of your progress|
| AGMEETING         | 0  | - Looks like you really spend some time on planning the structure of your project (good dfds)
                           - We got the impression that you take testing seriously
                           - We like your planning of feature implementation deadlines | 
| AGMEETING         | 1  | - You really spend sometime planning what needs to be included and what are the important bits to watch out for we
                           got the feeling you represent this in your tech stack 
                           - Same applies for the architecture and the general requirements
                           - We think it could be helpful to come up with a more detailed deadline schedule, to keep track of the progress |
| AGMEETING         | 2  | - We liked you DFD as it enabled as to get a good overview of what the system will be doing
                           - Maybe you can explain a bit more detailed, why you decided for this tech stack
                           - We also got the impression, that your time planning, was pretty high level, it could be helpful, to include a more detailed deadline plan, to keep track of the progress you are making|
