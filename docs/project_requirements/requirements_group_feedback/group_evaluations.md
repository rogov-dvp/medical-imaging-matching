| Ethics Dashboard  | 0  | <ul><li>Audio looped when explaining about APIs they were planning on using.</li><li>The audio during the explanation of the DFD was very choppy which made it hard to understand.</li><li>There is no mention of testing on the actual code, are you going to be performing any form of unit or integration testing?</li><li>We found the DFD diagrams hard to read initially, as it sometimes seems like while you used a singular directional arrow data was actually flowing both ways.</li></ul>|
| Ethics Dashboard  | 1  | <ul><li>We found your DFDs to be very clear and detailed, good work!</li><li>How do your milestones correspond with the milestones we must meet in class?</li><li>The testing plan is very comprehensive and the diagrams shown helped illustrate your plan well.</li><li>We liked that a consideration for your tech stack was maintainability by future developers. Good forward thinking!</li></ul>|
| Ethics Dashboard  | 2  | <ul><li>How are you integrating Google Docs for collboration? Are they just going to be linked to a google document? Will it be a view within the site?</li><li>Your DFDs are very detailed. Generally speaking, level0 DFDs usually show the system as a single process with its relationship to external entities. We would recommend reviewing the DFD level0 and level1 definitions and potentially refactoring yours.</li><li>It is unclear which features are to be done by what milestone in the DFD and the features assigned to milestones wasn't elaborated on.</li><li>What are you using to perform unit and function tests?</li></ul> |

| LIMS              | 1  | <ul><li>We really liked your explanation of how you came up with the tech stack</li><li>Your DFD was pretty high level so it is kind of hard to give very detailed feedback</li><li>Maybe it will be helpful to include a more detailed plan of feature deadlines so you can keep track of your progress</li></ul>|
| LIMS              | 2  | <ul><li>Good introduction into your project, helped us to understand the rest better</li><li>very detailed non functional requirements, this gave us the feeling you are really aware of what to watch out for</li><li>It could be helpful to plan your progress and deadlines a bit more detailed, so you can keep track of your progress</li></ul>|

| MIM               | 0  | <ul><li>We really enjoyed watching your teams video, there was alot of detail and thought put into the presentation, from the presentation you are able to get an informed grasp on the requirements of the project.</li><li> The idea of incorporating parrallel processing is a very smart idea.</li><li> We found the DFD level one slightly crowded maybe try simplifiying this diagram so it will be simpler to follow the flow of the diagram.</li></ul>|
