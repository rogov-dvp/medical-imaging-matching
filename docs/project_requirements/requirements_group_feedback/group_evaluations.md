| Ethics Dashboard  | 0  | <ul><li>Audio looped when explaining about APIs they were planning on using.</li><li>The audio during the explanation of the DFD was very choppy which made it hard to understand.</li><li>There is no mention of testing on the actual code, are you going to be performing any form of unit or integration testing?</li><li>We found the DFD diagrams hard to read initially, as it sometimes seems like while you used a singular directional arrow data was actually flowing both ways.</li></ul>|
| Ethics Dashboard  | 1  | <ul><li>We found your DFDs to be very clear and detailed, good work!</li><li>How do your milestones correspond with the milestones we must meet in class?</li><li>The testing plan is very comprehensive and the diagrams shown helped illustrate your plan well.</li><li>We liked that a consideration for your tech stack was maintainability by future developers. Good forward thinking!</li></ul>|
| Ethics Dashboard  | 2  | <ul><li>How are you integrating Google Docs for collboration? Are they just going to be linked to a google document? Will it be a view within the site?</li><li>Your DFDs are very detailed. Generally speaking, level0 DFDs usually show the system as a single process with its relationship to external entities. We would recommend reviewing the DFD level0 and level1 definitions and potentially refactoring yours.</li><li>It is unclear which features are to be done by what milestone in the DFD and the features assigned to milestones wasn't elaborated on.</li><li>What are you using to perform unit and function tests?</li></ul> |
