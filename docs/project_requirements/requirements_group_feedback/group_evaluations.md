| Cyclops           | 0  | <ul><li>We think the slides could have been done a bit more organized. For example, under User Groups, why not list the three different user groups then write a small description about them under it.</li><li>DFD level 1 was nicely done.</li><li>Regarding "choosing tech stack", why is Unity considered for a web development project. Just seems a bit strange As well, isn't having to choose any of the three biggest JavaScript Frameworks with Ionic would be considered a "pro" attribute? Additionally, we are a bit confused about what does "Transitioning from app into website is easier" mean. Did you mean to say that it's easy to turn an ionic app into an android or ios app?</li><li>Testing was good, nice</li><li>Final note, 13:37min, is significantly longer than the 10min limit for the video.</li><ul>|
| Cyclops           | 1  | <ul><li>DFD looks very nice and clean, especially DFD level 1.</li><li>Why is basic styling included in Peer Testing #1. We feel like that is not an essential part of the project. Shouldn't something like the Eco Tracker (or atleast a portion?) be part of Peer Testing #1.</li><li>We think it would great if the team could explain how they plan to work with the other Cyclops groups. We say this becuse it seems like other groups plan to use different stack. So, how could different tech stack come together or is each team creating their own web app?</li><li>Why was Ruby on Rails chosen over something popular like React.js?</li><li>We like the egyption/nature background music :)</li><ul>|
| Cyclops           | 2  | <ul><li>The DFD are missing the objects being passed between the components. They are quite essential to understanding a DFD.</li><li>Regarding testing, isn't your team the "developers" who need to choose a testing? We think it would be great hear which testing method your team chooses</li><li>Just a thought, in the Non-Function Requirements slide, it is stated that a well defined technical documentation is required. How will your team ensure that they will develop this. Ie. does your team plan to update the technical document as they create features or will it all be completed by the end of the Peer Testing?</li><li>Overall, a solid presentation</li></ul>|

| LIMS              | 0  | - Really good intro clarified the project and its relevance
                           - You really put some effort into the planning and structuring of your project, we feel like you know how to tackle th upcoming challenges
                           - We had some issues following DFD Level 1 as the picture was blurry and the description of it was high level, maybe you can clarify this in the report if not already done
                           - Your Milestone planning looked pretty high level maybe it will help you to make a more detailed deadline plan for every feature, for the first mileston, to keep track of the progress 
                           - Were there any other reasons for choosing django than your experience?
                           - Good Test planning |
| LIMS              | 1  | - We really liked your explanation of how you came up with the tech stack
                           - Your DFD was pretty high level so it is kind of hard to give very detailed feedback
                           - Maybe it will be helpful to include a more detailed plan of feature deadlines so you can keep track of your progress|
| LIMS              | 2  | - Good introduction into your project, helped us to understand the rest better
                           - very detailed non functional requirements, this gave us the feeling you are really aware of what to wtch out for
                           - It could be helpful to plan your progress and deadlines a bit more detailed, so you can keep track of your progress|
| Ethics Dashboard  | 0  | <ul><li>Audio looped when explaining about APIs they were planning on using.</li><li>The audio during the explanation of the DFD was very choppy which made it hard to understand.</li><li>There is no mention of testing on the actual code, are you going to be performing any form of unit or integration testing?</li><li>We found the DFD diagrams hard to read initially, as it sometimes seems like while you used a singular directional arrow data was actually flowing both ways.</li></ul>|
| Ethics Dashboard  | 1  | <ul><li>We found your DFDs to be very clear and detailed, good work!</li><li>How do your milestones correspond with the milestones we must meet in class?</li><li>The testing plan is very comprehensive and the diagrams shown helped illustrate your plan well.</li><li>We liked that a consideration for your tech stack was maintainability by future developers. Good forward thinking!</li></ul>|
| Ethics Dashboard  | 2  | <ul><li>How are you integrating Google Docs for collboration? Are they just going to be linked to a google document? Will it be a view within the site?</li><li>Your DFDs are very detailed. Generally speaking, level0 DFDs usually show the system as a single process with its relationship to external entities. We would recommend reviewing the DFD level0 and level1 definitions and potentially refactoring yours.</li><li>It is unclear which features are to be done by what milestone in the DFD and the features assigned to milestones wasn't elaborated on.</li><li>What are you using to perform unit and function tests?</li></ul> |
| Woo Woo           | 0  | <ul><li>Have you considered implementing integration and functional testing to ensure that your front-end and back-end are communicating properly? This might be helpful considering your unfamiliarity with the existing code.</li><li>We would advise being careful scheduling so much work in this first semester. Do you expect data validation to last the entirety of second term?</li><li>In your DFD, we noticed that you don't have anything scheduled to be developed for your final product milestone, what are you planning on doing between peer-testing #2 and the final milestone?</li><li>Is your tech stack determined by the client? If not why have you chosen it?</li></ul>|
| Woo Woo           | 1  | <ul><li>We noticed that you don't mention a login for users or healers in your DFD diagrams. Where does that functionality fit in?</li><li>We would advise being careful about scheduling so many features to be completed by peer testing #1.</li><li>What technology are you planning on using to code and perform your tests?</li></ul> |
| Woo Woo           | 2  | <ul><li>We never considered developers as a user group, good thinking!</li><li>We noticed that you don't mention a login or signup for users or healers in your DFD diagrams. Where does that functionality fit in?</li><li>What are the options for your tech stack? What are the pros and cons associated with each?</li></ul>|

What were the downsides of them so you ended up with go?</li></ul>|
| AGMEETING         | 0  | <ul><li>Looks like you really spend some time on planning the structure of your project</li><li>we noticed that only a moderator and admin can provide documents to the vault, would you ever see the need for participants to provide a document to the vault?</li><li>We like your planning of feature implementation deadlines, but it seems like you will be done by Milestone 2? Do you think this is realistic, given the amount of work you have?</li><li>We got the impression that you take testing seriously</li></ul>|
| AGMEETING         | 1  | <ul><li>You really spend sometime planning what needs to be included and what are the important bits to watch out for we got the feeling you represent this in your tech stack, but was the stack given by the client or did you also consider other alternatives?</li><li>Same applies for the architecture and the general requirements</li><li>We think it could be helpful to come up with a more detailed deadline schedule, to keep track of the progress</li></ul>|
| AGMEETING         | 2  | <ul><li>We liked your DFD as it enabled as to get a good overview of what the system will be doing, but you put moderator and admin in the same box eventhough there descritptions look different afterwards, maybe it would be helpful to split them?</li><li>Maybe you can explain a bit more detailed, why you decided for this tech stack</li><li>We also got the impression, that your time planning, was pretty high level, it could be helpful, to include a more detailed deadline plan, to keep track of the progress you are making</li></ul>|
