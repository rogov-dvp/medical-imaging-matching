*Model*
- Euclidean Distance Model
- MSE/SSIM Model
- RootSIFT Model
- Siamese Networks
- Adapting Facial recognition
- Probalistic Matching

*Dataset*
- Preprocessing
    - Cleaning of Data
- Split data into training and testing
    - per type of image (will need same patient, same type of image for a match)

*Testing*
- Unittests for each function per model
- Testing/training for each model
    - testing for acceptable result percentile
- Testing for Data preprocessing (per function in preprocessing script)
- Implementation Testing?
- Acceptance Testing

*Documentation*
- For each model
   - Input/Output for each model
   - Layman's description (what does it do and how?)
- For each function
   - Input/Output
   - Quick sentence for what it is for
- Overall documentation
   - Requirements
   - How to run the model
