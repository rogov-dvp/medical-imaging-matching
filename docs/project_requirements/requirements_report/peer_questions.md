# Requirements Report

These are the questions we received from our peers on our requirements presentation and our corresponding answers.

## Peer Reviews

|Question|Answer|
|:-------|:-----|
|Do you have any specific facial recognition models in mind for your project?| We are currently looking into FaceNet as it is one of the most popular models with really good performance and wide documentation, but we are unsure if this will work for our data as it focuses on face-specific attributes, especially in the deeper layers, which may make it not applicable.|
|Do you have any concerns about the efficiency of this program?| While we will be attempting to make this as efficient as possible, our client is more focused on the accuracy of the results rather than the time it takes to get the results.|
| Do you have an implementation plan for the project yet?| We will be following the Gantt chart. We will begin working on the preprocessing algorithm. Then we will create the Similarity Matching Algorithm. Finally, we will create the image matching script which holds the logic, manages the other two components, and communicates with the client. At this point, our focus will be to refine the algorithms to increase its performance and accuracy.|
| Do you have plans to host your software? Will it remain local software?| It will most likely remain local due to the heavy security and hosting requirements that come with having to upload medical data. Remaining local on the BC Cancer network is the better option currently.|
|You say that all you’re building is an algorithm that the end user will be interfacing with through a command line. And then you say your final milestone is a ‘possible ui’. A doctor or nurse won’t be able to type command line and pass in images to this thing. Does the client have a trained IT person do this task? Right now you say that they have a professional come in, and manually compare scans to identify matches. But if you give them this algorithm, won't they still have to have an IT person come in to use the command line/ or GUI that you may make?| We are creating this project for BC Cancer researchers, of which there may be nurses and doctors but they are not a group for which we are developing. According to our client, all BC Cancer researchers that will be using this script will have the knowledge required to use the command line or terminal to run the script. We will also be providing documentation detailing how to run the project. So no, the intended user group will be able to run the script.|
|For your non-functional requirements, under security, you say the data has to stay in the BC cancer network. The client has to give you guys real training and testing sets. Isn’t that a breach of security? What steps have you and the client taken to ensure security during development?|We will be accessing the BC Cancer network remotely when using the provided test and training sets that must remain in the BC Cancer network. This in conjunction with the ethics course and confidentiality agreement we signed ensures that there is no breach of security. We will also be using open-sourced data to test on our local machines while we wait to be granted access to the data. |
|How do you plan to run your continuous integration testing? This seems like a fairly comprehensive system so I'm wondering if you're planning to run it through github actions or another solution like Jenkins, CircleCI, or something else?| We were planning on running it through GitHub actions, but we will take a look at your suggestions.|
|The video says that the unit test library will be used to test for accessing the data safely. Will the team attempt any form of intrusion testing?|We had not considered intrusion testing. We are not sure if the testing framework would fit our project as the script/models will be run on BC Cancer’s servers, there should be no additional legwork for us required. However, we will keep that in mind in case the requirements or the hosting of the script changes.|
|Have you identified the weak points that you will need to focus on in order to ensure security of the system, and if so how are you going to address them?|As we will be running the script on BC Cancer’s server we don’t anticipate security problems in regards to data privacy. However, we will be ensuring that all the models and libraries we use are open-sourced and can be used without allowing access to their system.|
|How do you plan on getting a test set of images?|The official training and test set will be provided by BC Cancer, while we are waiting for that we will be using an open-source dataset containing mammograms.|
|How do you plan to store and access the processed data?|We will be storing processed data in a “processed” folder on their file system. This way we can avoid reprocessing images. As we will be reading in mammograms from the file structure, we will first check if it has already been processed. If it has, we can avoid processing it again, if not we will continue with processing the image. |
|There are four types of results, namely True Positive, False Positive, True Negative, and False Negative. How do you define the 70-90 percent accuracy considering the four results?| We will be using the standard accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score to calculate the efficacy of our model. The calculations are as follows: $$Accuracy = \frac{number of correctly classified test sample}{total number of test sample}$$ In terms of the question the equation would be as follows: $$Accuracy = \frac{True Positive + True Negative}{True Positive + True Negative + False Positive + False Negative}$$ However, this number can be misleading or not show the full picture, so we will also be using the equations below to get a robust understanding of the model’s performance. $$Precision = \frac{number of relevant results that were ranked or retrieved}{number of retrieved results}$$ This can be defined as of those predicted to be true, proportion that are true. In the terms of the question the calculation would be: $$Precision = \frac{True Positive}{True Positive + False Positive}$$ $$Recall = \frac{number of relevant results that were ranked or retrieved}{number of relevant results}$$ This can be defined as the actual true results, proportion predicted to be true. In the terms of the question the equation would look like this: $$Recall = \frac{True Positives}{True Positives + False Negatives}$$ We will also look at specificity, which is of the actual false results, proportion predicted false: $$Specificity = \frac{True Negative}{False Positive + True Negative}$$ $$F1Score = 2*\frac{precision*recall}{precision + recall}$$ As it would be more costly for us to miss out on a match, we will be focusing mostly on precision, accuracy, and/or recall rather than specificity (ie. maximizing precision). As precision and recall are essentially similar measures, we will be focusing on the F1Score which is a harmonic mean between precision and recall. Research has shown that F1Scores are generally more reliable than misclassification rates (especially for unbalanced datasets, which is what ours is), therefore that is what we will be focusing on maximizing and what will be informing our models’ performance.|
