**Models**

- We are planning to try a Convolutional Neural Net with 4 Convolutional and 4 pooling layers, connected to a Neural Net first, to experiment with TensorFlow and start things off. We are not expecting really good results from this, but think that it is a good approach to set everything up and see whether every component of the system works before we start trying more complex models and experiment with the other components.
